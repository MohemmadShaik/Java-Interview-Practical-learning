We must and should know collections concepts  in java  then only will know the exact difference between Comparator and Comparable.

Actually Comparator and Comparable concepts come into picture when  we want to sort the collection objects in ascending or descending order.

So let's cover the below topics related to collections:

1. Collection API, collection and collections
2. ArrayList in java
3. Set in java
4. Map in java
5. Comparator VS Comparable in java


1. Collection API, collection and collections
=============================================

Collection API --> it's a concept

The collection API is introduced in Java 1.2 version to 
work with all data structures by using some inbuilt classes and interfaces.

Inshort :
- When dealing with Collection API concepts, we have 
  multiple classes and interfaces to work with.

- By using Collection API we can store data and we can use
  different algorithms to work with it.

collection --> If we are dealing with interface
The root interface for most of the collection types.
Common implementation for List, Set, Queue Interfaces.
collections --> If we are dealing with classes
A utility class with static methods for collection operations (e.g., sorting, searching).
Provides methods like sort(), reverse(), and synchronizedList().

Key Note : Both collection and collections can be found in java.util. package.

Q) How to implement the collection?

We can implement collection using either List, Set , Queue or Map.
