Kindly be prepared for the below questions?
===========================================

Question 1:
- - - - - -

Scenario:
^^^^^^^^
You have to design a solution (classes, interfaces, etc etc) for DeckofCards. 
Each card has a suit (heart, spade, club, diamond) and 
a rank (ace, king, queen jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). 

Problem 1 - Write a function to Compare two cards and return bigger one. Suit doesnt matter. 
Problem 2 - You are given a shuffled deck of cards. You have to sort them (by suit and then by rank) 

Problem 1 - Is the function signature correctly implemented (2 args which represent the 2 cards) and returns a card?.
			What if a Joker is introduced in the pack. How will you represent a Joker ?.
			Are the Cards, Deck Suit, Rank properly represented with Enums, Classes, Objects.
Problem 2 - Is the Candidate aware of Comparator and Comparable interfaces ?.

Problem 1 - Is the logic correctly implemented (comparison, null checks).
Problem 2 - Is the comparator logic correctly implemented ?.

Question 2:
- - - - - -

Can one use an Employee class as a key in a HashMap? 
( This is a very important question. If this is not answered satisfactorily, mark the
  candidate as knowledge gap as best case scenario irrespective of answers to other
  questions / scenarios )

Question 3:
===========
Consider a class A with a synchronized method
 class A { 
	public void synchronized m1() {
						Thread.sleep(5000);
    } 
  } 

We create two objects of this class - o1 and o2. 
We call o1.m1() on one thread and o2.m1() on another thread, at the same time. 
What will be the behaviour? 
Follow up with - how will you force these calls to execute one after the other

Question 4:
- - - - - -

Flatten nested arrays in java. 
1. Numbers or nested arrays can be upto n levels. 
2. Recursive approach -
Employee Table -- Id -- Name -- Salary -- Department id 
Find one employee from each department who is getting the highest salary within his department. 
Discuss further on server side pagination, boundary cases like 2 emp getting the same salary in the same department which is highest etc.

Question 5:
- - - - - -
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order

Question 6 :
- - - - - -
Find Out the Correct Output for Below Code. 
Check whether candidate knows about wheteher static methods are not polymorphic or not. 
Code: 
=====

	class Parent { 
		static void staticMethod() { 
			System.out.println("Static method in Parent"); 
		}
		
	} 
	class Child extends Parent {
       static void staticMethod() {
			System.out.println("Static method in Child"); 
	   } 
	} 
	public class StaticMethodTest {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Parent.staticMethod();
			Child.staticMethod();
			Parent parent = new Child(); 
			parent.staticMethod(); 
		} 
	}
	
Question 7:
- - - - - -
Given an array containing n integers. The problem is to find the sum of the elements of
the contiguous subarray having the smallest(minimum) sum. 
Input : arr[] = {3, -4, 2, -3, -1, 7, -5} 
Output : -6 
Subarray is {-4, 2, -3, -1} = -6 
Input : arr = {2, 6, 8, 1, 4} 
Output : 1
